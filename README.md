## About project

This project is Swamp Attack game clone. I am making this game on the IJunior course, but with a different, more flexible and good architecture without MonoBehaviours, static and etc. Trying to do clear OOP

In this game, you need to reflect the waves of minotaurs! You can buy new weapons in the store and buy ammo for existing ones. The game is still in development

### Techniques
 - Project trying to use **OOP**, **SOLID** and maybe **GRASP**
 - Clean **DI** (no trash like Zenject, VContainer and etc.)
 - **MV** Arhitecture style, where model controls view
 - Composite Root
 
### Tools
 - UniTask
 - Odin Inspector
 
 ## Conclusion
 
This project helped me understand how much I did not understand OOP before, taught me how to make a flexible architecture, model the subject area, write tests, and much more. During development, I began to understand much more things than before, and this was my first step towards a real understanding of the great and powerful OOP. Thanks to my friend and colleague [Farid](https://github.com/Farid357) for help in some moments :heart:
